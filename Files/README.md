# CAnD3 Reproducible Research Project

## Project Overview

This study investigates disparities in self-rated mental health among young adults aged 18-39 in Canada, across socio-demographic characteristics, using data from the 2017 General Social Survey, Public Microdata Files. After adjusting for age, household income, and other confounders, the results show that being **female** and **single** or **divorced/ widowed** were significantly associated with higher odds of reporting poor or fair mental health compared to males and those who were married or in common-law relationships, respectively.

In contrast, **higher household income** was protective against poor/fair mental health, with individuals in households earning $100k or more having significantly lower odds of reporting poor/fair mental health compared to those with a household income of less than $50k. Being an **immigrant** was also associated with lower odds of reporting poor or fair mental health compared to non-immigrants.

Regarding education, having a **university degree** was significantly associated with lower odds of poor/fair mental health compared to individuals with less than a high school education. No significant associations were found between **visible minority status**, **middle household income**, or **educational attainment** at the high school/trade/college level and poor/fair mental health.

## Data Description

The data used in this study comes from the 2017 General Social Survey (Cycle 31): Family, a Statistics Canada's Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs). The data is obtained through ODESI, a service provided by the Ontario Council of University Libraries.

Access to ODESI is restricted to users with a DLI License, and it can be used for statistical and research purposes. The terms of the license can be found [here](https://odesi-ca.lib-ezproxy.concordia.ca/en/terms).

McGill University's CAnD3 initiative has a license to use the data for training purposes. Those outside McGill University should not use the data provided through CAnD3's training activities for purposes unrelated to CAnD3 training. Those from another DLI institution should download the data using ODESI through their institution.
